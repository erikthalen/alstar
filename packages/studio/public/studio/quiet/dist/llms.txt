# Quiet UI

> A UI library for the Web with a focus on accessibility, longevity, performance, and simplicity.

Quiet UI provides a comprehensive set of accessible, customizable web components for building modern web applications.
All of its custom elements use shadow DOM. Its form controls are form-associated elements that follow native form
control patterns such as the Constraint Validation API.

The current version of Quiet UI is: 1.6.1

Quiet offers an optional, opinionated, classless CSS reset called Quiet Restyle that's good for building out new
websites and apps.

Tabler is the default icon library, so `<quiet-icon family="..." name="...">` values must come from this manifest,
where `outline` and `filled` are the only family options: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tabler/icons@3/icons.json

When installing Quiet, follow the instructions on https://quietui.org/docs/ to install the components, theme, and the
optional CSS reset. Users can install the library using the Autoloader via CDN (recommended) or via npm (bundlers and
advanced use cases).

**Properties:**

- `isTransitioning`: Determines if the transition group is currently animating. (Property only) (Type: `boolean`, Default: `false`)

- `transitionContainer`: By default, the transition group observes and animates its own children. In some cases, you may want it to control another element's children. This is useful in cases where you can't directly wrap child elements with the `<quiet-transition-group>` element.  For example, if you embed a transition group in a component's shadow root but need it to control slotted (light DOM) elements, you can't simply wrap the slot because the mutation observer can't see projected (slotted) elements. In this case, point this property to the target element and the transition group will hide itself and observe the target container's children instead. (Property only) (Type: `HTMLElement`, Default: `this`)

**Methods:**

- `transitionComplete()`: Returns a promise that resolves when the current transition ends. If no transition is running, it resolves immediately  This is a great way to ensure transitions have stopped before doing something else, such as adding or removing new elements to the transition group.
- `updateElementPositions()`: Updates the cached coordinates of all child elements in the transition group. In most cases, you shouldn't have to call this method. However, if you're resizing or animating elements imperatively, you may need to call this immediately before appending or removing elements to ensure a smooth transition.

**Events:**

- `quiet-content-changed`: Emitted when content changes and before the transition animation begins.
- `quiet-transition-end`: Emitted when transition animations end.

**CSS Custom Properties:**

- `--duration`: The duration of each individual step (not the total transition time). (Default: `0.25s`)

**CSS Custom States:**

**Events:**

- `quiet-animation-complete`: Emitted when the typing animation has completed.
